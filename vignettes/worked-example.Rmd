## Setup

```{r}
library(predictFishRMR)

# for plotting and tibble manipulation
library(tidyverse)


```

## Introduction

Here we use the functions in the pacakge `predictFishRMR` to predict various features of a fishe's metabolism and ecological constraints based on their mass and physiology type. 

For this example we pick a fish with mass = 30kg.

```{r}

mm <- 30

# Estimate the cooling coefficient K
K <- kfun(m = mm)

# Estimate routine metabolic rate RMR over the range of 
# RMR <- RMRfun()



```
