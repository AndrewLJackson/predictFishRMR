\usage{
RMRfun(m, Tm, meso, pars)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{body mass in g, typically provided as a vector but could be scalar.}

\item{Tm}{body temperature in C}

\item{meso}{a logical value where TRUE indicates mesotherm and FALSE
indicates ectotherm}

\item{pars}{a vector of length 4 containing the coefficients of the
corresponding fitted linear regression}
}
\value{
a vector the same length as input m containing the corresponding
  estimates of resting metabolic rate RMR
}
